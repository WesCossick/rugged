## When to test

- Your package runs in a specific framework/library, like React, Angular, or Vue.js

## What to test

Test that your package works inside the context of this framework/library. You may also want to test that your package works in different versions of this framework/library. For example, if your package is designed to work with React, you could test that it works with both React v16 and React v17, by creating `react-v16` and `react-v17` test projects.

## How to set up

This will vary based on the framework you’re using.
